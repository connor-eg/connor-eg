Hello! I am Connor Garcia.
I can be reached at connoregarcia@gmail.com

I am currently learning Java on my own time, and am excited to see what types of projects this will enable me to make. My goal, however, is to focus on learning Kotlin so that I can make mobile applications. I have elected to learn Java because Kotlin incorporates Java into itself and so covering Java first will give me a stronger/more general base of knowledge to start from before moving to Kotlin.
